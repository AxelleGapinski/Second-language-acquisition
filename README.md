# Second-language-acquisition

Study conducted with Aine Drelingyte as part of M2 NLP masters at Lorraine University.

# Abstract

The aim of this study is to examine how native language structures impact the acquisition of English lexicon in children who are native speakers of Cantonese and Spanish. By providing an extensive review of relevant literature and exploring both existing and new hypotheses using the SLA talkbank data, this research delves into the complexities of bilingual language development. The analysis focuses on the frequency of various parts of speech in the English vocabulary of these children at the ages of 1, 2, and 4. The findings highlight both similarities and distinct differences in language acquisition patterns, influenced significantly by each group's linguistic background. This study not only contributes to our understanding of bilingual lexicon development but also offers valuable insights for educational approaches in bilingual settings.
